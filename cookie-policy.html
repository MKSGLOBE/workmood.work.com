	<h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
	<p>
		

		Last updated December 13, 2022
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
	This Cookie Policy explains how Fuel Wings India Private Limited (“    Company,” “we,” “us,”
		and “our“) uses cookies and similar technologies to
	recognize you when you visit our website at<a href="http://fuelwings.com/" target="_blank">http://fuelwings.com</a> (“    Website“). It explains what these technologies are and why
		we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
		<br/>
		In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that
		becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.
		<br/>
		<b>What are cookies?</b>
		<br/>
		Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
		device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
		in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
		as to provide reporting information.
		<br/>
		Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Fuel Wings India Private
		Limited ) are called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other
		than the website owner are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party
		cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or
		through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
		analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize
		your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it
		visits certain other websites.
		<br/>
		<b>Why do we use cookies?</b>
		<br/>
		We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are
		required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we
		refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other
		cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
		enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve
		cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
		This is described in more detail below.
		<br/>
		<b>How can I control cookies?</b>
		<br/>
		You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
		exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
		Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
		categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
		rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
		<br/>
		The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
		our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website
		though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be
		restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept
		or refuse cookies.
		<br/>
		The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our
		Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below
		(please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
		specific Online Properties you visit):
		<br/>
		<b>How can I control cookies on my browser?</b>
		<br/>
		As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser
		controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser’s help
		menu for more information. The following is information about how to manage
		cookies on the most popular browsers:

		<b>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</b>
		<br/>
		Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
		We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
		(sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny
		graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to
		recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including
		them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users
		from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
		cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online
		advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
		performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In
		many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
		properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
		<br/>
		<b>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</b>
		<br/>
		Websites may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as Local Shared
		Objects or “LSOs”) to, among other things, collect and store information
		about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site
		operations.
		<br/>
		If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
		the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the
		tools contained in the
		<a
			href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"
			target="_blank"
		>
			Website Storage Settings Panel
		</a>
		. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
		<a
			href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"
			target="_BLANKL"
		>
			Global Storage Settings Panel
		</a>
		and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
		explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
		“information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being
		placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
		and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the
		operator of the page you are on at the time).
		<br/>
		Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance
		of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
		applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection
		with our services or online content.
		<br/>
		<b>Do you serve targeted advertising?</b>
		<br/>
		Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
		advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about
		your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
		advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They
		may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of
		advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to
		collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to
		provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential
		interest to you. The information collected through this process does not
		enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details
		that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
		<br/>
		<b>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</b>
		<br/>
		We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
		example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or
		regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly
		to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
		<br/>
		The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last
		updated.
		<br/>
		<b>Where can I get further information?</b>
		<br/>
		If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies,
		please email us at info@fuelwings.in or by post to:
